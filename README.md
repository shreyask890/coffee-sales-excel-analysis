Order Date Filter: At the top left corner, there’s a filter for “Order Date” ranging from 2018 to 2022. This allows users to view sales data for a specific time period.

Total Sales over Time: Below the date filter is a colorful line graph displaying fluctuating sales from 2018 to 2022. Each line in the graph represents different types of coffee roasts, each having its unique color.

Roast Type, Size, and Loyalty Card Filters: On the top right corner are filters for “Roast Type Name” (Dark or Medium) and “Size” (12 oz or 10 oz), along with an option to filter by “Loyalty Card” ownership (Yes or No). These filters allow users to view sales data based on specific product attributes or customer behaviors.

Sales by Country: Below these filters are two bar graphs titled “Sales by Country”. One is in USD currency showing total revenue per country; another shows total units sold per country. This provides a comparative view of sales performance across different countries.
